## 🔐 Security Measures

### 🛡️ Application Security
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy implemented
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **XSS Protection**: X-XSS-Protection headers set
- **MIME Sniffing**: X-Content-Type-Options protection
- **Clickjacking**: X-Frame-Options protection

### 🔑 API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for all API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation for all inputs
- **Authentication**: Supabase-based secure authentication
- **Authorization**: User-based access controls

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Security
- **Sandboxing**: E2B isolated execution environments
- **HTTPS**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data isolated
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-based production logs
- **Security Events**: Special security event tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management
- **Audit Trail**: API request logging

## 🚫 Security Best Practices

### 🔐 For Developers

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# ❌ Never commit these files
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# ✅ Use .env.example instead
cp .env.example .env
```

#### API Key Management
```typescript
// ❌ Never hardcode API keys
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890"

// ✅ Use environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
```

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// ✅ Always validate inputs
const schema = z.object({
  message: z.string().min(1).max(1000),
  userId: z.string().uuid()
})

const result = schema.parse(userInput)
```

#### Logging
```typescript
// ❌ Don't log sensitive data
logger.info('User login', { password: userPassword })

// ✅ Sanitize sensitive information
logger.info('User login', { userId: user.id })
```

### 🏢 For Deployments

#### Production Environment
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Enable all security headers
- Set up proper CORS policies
- Configure rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activities

#### Secrets Management
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Implement least privilege access
- Use secure secret storage services

## 🔍 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] API keys rotated and secured
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Dependency security audit (monthly)
- [ ] API key rotation (quarterly)
- [ ] Security review (quarterly)
- [ ] Penetration testing (annually)

## 🐛 Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Services
- **E2B Sandboxes**: Code execution in isolated environments
- **AI APIs**: External API calls to LLM providers
- **Supabase**: Third-party authentication service
- **PostHog**: Analytics data collection

### Mitigation Strategies
- All third-party integrations use official SDKs
- API keys are properly scoped and rotated
- User data is sanitized before external calls
- Monitoring for abnormal usage patterns

## 📋 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Scope
This security policy applies to:
- E2B Fragments application code
- Deployment configurations
- Third-party integrations
- User data handling

### Out of Scope
- Third-party service vulnerabilities (report to respective vendors)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- DoS attacks using automated tools

### Safe Harbor
We support security research and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Do not access or modify user data
- Do not perform destructive testing
- Comply with all applicable laws
